* nix-mirror
There is an unsolved issue https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2774 indirectly
relaated to problems in mirroring nix binary cache due to excessive complexity
of the =nix= tool for such a simple task. Meanwhile, I address the issue in a
separate project.

* goals
** nix binary cache mirroring
*** input
- file with a list of store paths
- file format as of =store-paths= from https://nixos.org/channels/
*** how
- downloading of =*.narinfo= with corresponding =*.nar.xz= with dependencies for
  - dependencies are read from =*.narinfo= from the field =References=
- checksumming of the downloaded =*.nar.xz=
- resumable downloads
- ensure files integrity after checksumming by utilizing btrfs snapshots
  capability
** all tarballs required for producing store paths with closures

* questions
- does the mirror process really benefit from the =req= package (instead of
  =http-conduit=)?
  * advantages: automatic retries
  * disadvantage: =req= brings twice more dependencies
